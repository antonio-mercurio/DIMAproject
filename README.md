# DIMAproject
Affinder is a rental app that aims at helping people to find or offer an accommodation or to find a flatmate. The idea came from our personal experience: as non-resident students in Milan, we found it difficult to find both a place to live in and compatible people to share the accommodation with.
All the project documentation can be found in the 'Documentation' folder. In particular, the Design Document includes detailed information on the architectural design, user interface, and the tests performed on the app to ensure its functionality and reliability.
